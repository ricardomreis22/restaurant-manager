IF the person is an admin, show the admin dashboard, if the person is a user, show the user dashboard.

For the admin dashboard, show the following:

- Add restaurant
- Floormap
  . make the tables move with drag and drop on click of the button
  . add tables to the floormap
- Add employee
  . change the add employee to a modal instead of new link page, and make it possible to edit the employee
- Add item
- Add category
- Add menu
- Add promotion
- Add review

As the employee login, the employee should be redirected to the user dashboard where the restaurant tables and can get inside a table a make the order.

---------Questions-------

So I did the difference between the admin and the staff in the login.ts, but right the only the staff can´t acess is the other restaurants.

Inside the restaurant the staff can see, he can´t see some pages as well like the employers page. And he can´t change the floorplan, etc.
How do I make the staff not be able to change this things? Do I have to make this things in a admin route and then make staff not able to access it?

---------- WATCH OUT -------

Can i delete the admin that create the restaurant?
